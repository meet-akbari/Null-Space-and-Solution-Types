# Null-Space-and-Solution-Types
This is the project of Linear Algebra which we have done in the 3rd semester of BTech. So the practical implementation of "find the null
space of given mxn matrix" problem through C programming is here, Kudos ;)

# to run this project :-
-> run the main_function.c file in your C compilor.
-> all other C files are already added as a header files in each other files, so don't worry about it.
